COULD DO:
- could change routing to use react router to not render the entire page when changing page - this is kinda long and unnecessary so leave it for later

USE CASES:
- login ✅
- register ✅ 
- submit ts ✅
- view ts ✅
- export timesheet ✅
- it support (change user passwords) ✅
- finance team see approved timesheets ✅
- approve/reject ts
- set reminders (maybe dont need to do this)
- get help: just record video and embed or put some ss with text descriptions
- edit rejected ts (prob would be hardest use case)


-mark overtime/holiday hours (either for each day or by tick)

NEED TO FIX:
week start date needs to have a default value
in view ts tab -> need to fix scrolling when many ts are there
show that username is taken

questions:
does login need to fully work
    if username exists show user
